Necessary files:
- Comparison map contains csv files of gold-standard and OCR text, as well as word accuracy for all text documents
- real_date.txt contains the id of these files
- count --> ocr.csv contains paragraph and dark-id connections

Problems:
- Gold standard is on paragraph level but ocr on textblock level. Paragraphs may coincide with textblocks, but also possible to be a subset of a textblock or split between several textblocks.

Need to:
- Decide on how to handle gold standard and ocr data being on different levels
- Use real_date.txt to scrape ocr.csv of correct dark-ids
- Draw a sample and compare to manual notation and check that data is correct (may contain small errors like wrong paragraph id)

Next step:
- FIRST Verify paragraph number discrepancies between real_date_fixed.csv and gold-standard files
- Create algo which opens csv file, looks for paragraph number, etc...

Notes:
- Ignore editions other than 0 or 1, the other ones are due to buggs difficult to retrieve
- Should be paragraph 29: DAGENS NYHETER 1947-10-06_upplaga-1_pagenr-11_paragraph31.csv
